Purpose: The purpose of these generic styling layer groups is to provide a range of comic book styles that users can apply to their desired subjects to create unique and engaging prompts. These layer groups focus on different aspects of comic book styles, such as layout, coloring, and themes, without mentioning specific artists.

Suggested Usage: To use these layer groups effectively, add a single subject layer with a high weight at the beginning of the prompt. This subject layer should describe the main topic or scene you want to focus on in the comic book style. For example, if you want to create a prompt for a superhero scene, add "superhero scene ::15" at the beginning of the chosen layer group.

Example:
Subject Layer: "superhero scene ::15"

What I typed that produced this result.

Prompt 1: 

Can you make a  list of generic styling layer groups that users who do not have access to chat gpt can use to make great comic book style prompts. 
I'd like to provide a useful range of comic book styles without using any specific artists. 
Lets use 250 tokens for each and not provide a subject, as the intention is for the user to fill them in. the intended subject.  
Start with a description of the purpose and  the suggested usage 
(add a single subject layer with a high weight at the beginning) including an example with suggested weight. 
Lets make these conform to the theory as best as possible.

Prompt 2: 
almost perfect... 
for each layer group provide one or two example comic titles that this style describes if we could use names comic geeks 
know like "golden age" for the group names that would also help 

Prompt 3: 

these are perfect, give me  many more styles  with no explanation other than the group and example comics
