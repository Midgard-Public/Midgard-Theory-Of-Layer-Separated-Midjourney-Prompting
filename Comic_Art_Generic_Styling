Purpose: The purpose of these generic styling layer groups is to
provide a range of comic book styles that users can apply to their
desired subjects to create unique and engaging prompts. These layer
groups focus on different aspects of comic book styles, such as
layout, coloring, and themes, without mentioning specific artists.

Suggested Usage: To use these layer groups effectively, add a single
subject layer with a high weight at the beginning of the prompt. This
subject layer should describe the main topic or scene you want to
focus on in the comic book style. For example, if you want to create
a prompt for a superhero scene, add "superhero scene ::15" at the
beginning of the chosen layer group.
