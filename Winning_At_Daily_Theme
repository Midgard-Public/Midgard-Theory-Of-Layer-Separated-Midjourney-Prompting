-----------------------------------------

We want to make sure the we mention specific iconic characters by and stay to the exact format  

" Space Squid Chasing Homer Simpson At Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in the style of the Simpsons by Matt Groening ::15 " 

Varying the iconic activity, character and location to fit each prompt. We also don't want boring actions like meeting or interacting with... I used chasing for a reason, they don't all have to be unfriendly though, I chose chasing because Homer is a dumb character and would run away looking funny. Another good example would be "Space Squid Stealing From Scrooge McDuck in McDuck Mansion in the style of Duck Tales by Carl Barks ::15 "

Additionally space squid needs some more unique flavor in each prompt, something like " color changing alien octopus in a space helmet ::4 " or " vibrant Aposematism nudibranch ::4" lets try to use different invertibrates with appropriate traits if we can but it's ok to repeat if we can't 

Also lets just stop using commas all together ... if we can replace it with and lets do that and if not just get rid of it

I understand the changes you want to make. Here are 10 prompts with specific iconic characters, actions, locations, and unique space squid traits:
