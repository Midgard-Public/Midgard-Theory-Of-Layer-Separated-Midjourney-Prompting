Midgard's Theory of Layer-Separated Prompt Generation For Midjourney With Chat GPT (The Theory):

Definitions:

[1] Comma-separated sections: Semantically merge ideas within a layer.
[2] Layer separators: Define the balance between the contributions of larger semantic clauses over the entire image.
[3] Guides: Factual statements about Midjourney prompting or important rules to follow.
[4] Tips: Special case rules, helpful rules of thumb, or guidance when choosing between different solutions.

Guides:

[1] Always make sure every guide is as true as possible with every prompt generation.
[2] Break the description into multiple layers, focusing on distinct aspects of the subject.
[3] Assign weights to each layer (::X, where X is a number) based on the importance or prominence of that aspect.
[4] Maintain a large dynamic range between the initial clause and any subsequent clauses, allowing the scale to adjust as low or high as necessary.
[5] Use negative weights to negate unwanted subjects or aspects, but ensure no zero or negative total layer weight.
[6] Include specific nouns from the request in the first clause.
[7] Emphasize descriptive nouns and visually descriptive phrases in the prompt.
[8] Utilize terms from relevant fields, such as art techniques, artistic mediums, and artist names, when describing styles.
[9] Stay within a token limit (e.g., 250 tokens) to ensure the entire list can be generated by ChatGPT.
[10] Don't use negative logical words like no, as Midjourney only understands positive phrases.
[11] For any negations, use negative layer weights.
[12] Always try to use the maximum number of tokens in each prompt, emphasizing additional harmonious descriptive styling and especially artists whenever possible.
[13] Have one high weight, one or two middle weight, and many light weight layers.
[14] When using negative layer weights, never negate a term that's also present in the positive part.
[15] Layer weights are normalized, so focus on relative values, not absolute values. Always normalize so the lowest non-zero non-negative prompt weight is 1. Using floating point numbers is acceptable if it helps.

Tips:

[1] Avoid phrases that don't have a literal visual meaning unless integral to the request, as they can result in unpredictability.
[2] For descriptive styling, use many short clauses separated by commas, combining compatible artists and styles whenever possible.
[3] Experiment with adjusting the layer weights until you achieve the desired emphasis in the final result.
[4] Modify prompts by changing layer weights, adding/changing/deleting words and phrases, or rearranging/adding/deleting layer separators.
[5] Employ more common language and concrete terms when modifying prompts for better results.
[6] Negation is most effective when a word has multiple meanings and the correct one must be selected or if a unexpected element keeps showing up in images.


Example:

Original prompt: Create an art piece featuring a serene landscape with a waterfall and a rainbow in the Impressionist style.

Scenic landscape, waterfall ::8. Birds flying, rainbow ::4. Impressionist style, Claude Monet ::2. Lush greenery, vibrant colors ::2. Serene atmosphere, calming nature ::1.

Let's say we want to emphasize the rainbow and change the art style to Art Nouveau.

Adjusted prompt:

Scenic landscape, waterfall ::8. Birds flying, rainbow ::6. Art Nouveau style, Alphonse Mucha ::4. Lush greenery, vibrant colors ::2. Serene atmosphere, calming nature ::1.
