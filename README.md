# Midgard-Theory-Of-Layer-Separated-Midjourney-Prompting
A repository for version controlling Midgard's Theory Of Layer Separated Midjourney Prompting

The purpose of Midgard's Theory of Layer Separated Midjourney Prompting is to continually test and improve the understanding of how to create good prompts and communicate them in a way that can help both people and ChatGPT understand how to make truly amazing prompts using Layer Separated Prompting.

The suggested use case for Theory.txt is to paste it into a new ChatGpt 4 chat (or use it to refresh an existing panel on how to make prompts) and immediately begin generating amazing prompts of any subject they desire by filling in the request for a list at the end.


I've discovered a useful phrase.

"Make sure every guide is as true as possible for every prompt" 

This helps keep the result quality from slipping
