Welcome to Midgard's Theory of Layer Separated Midjourney
Prompting, a scientifically-proven method for utilizing the
multiprompting feature ::X in Midjourney to consistently
generate high-quality images with ChatGPT 4.0.

# The Theory
Through rigorous testing and iterative hypothesis refinement,
we've developed a cohesive working model that delivers
repeatable results. The theory enables you to effectively
harness the full potential of ChatGPT 4.0 for generating
diverse and engaging prompts, leading to stunning images using
Midjourney.

# How to Use
1. Open your ChatGPT 4.0 instance (Note: This method works
exclusively with ChatGPT 4.0, which is not currently free).
2. Copy the contents of Theory.txt into your ChatGPT 4.0
interface.
3. Add your specific request for prompts at the end of the
text.
4. Enjoy generating amazing prompts and create high-quality
images for any subject or theme!

# Purpose
The purpose of this theory is to continually test, refine, and
improve our understanding of how to create great prompts using
Layer Separated Prompting. With this approach, both people and
ChatGPT can collaborate to generate exceptional prompts for
various subjects or themes.

# Friendly Reminder
"Make sure every guide is as true as possible for every prompt"
- This mantra helps maintain high-quality results and prevents
any degradation in the output.
